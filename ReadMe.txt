Notes to Future Developers or Observers

-The device is plug-and-play, hook the 9v and micro-usb port up to power. The device is currently hardcoded to connect to a certain WiFi IP and Password, adjustment to the NodeMCU Arduino code is needed for non-proponent use.
-The database of the the application is firebase which is cloud-based. The application will work without paying mind to it, but any database or cloud function concerns require the firebase credentials that the proponents used for the project.
